  <h2 id="what-is-vulkan">What is Vulkan?</h2>

    <p>Vulkan is a modern graphics and compute API developed by the Khronos Group.</p>
    <p>It provides fine-grained, low-level access to the GPU, enabling high performance and greater control for developers.</p>

    <p>In this blog post, I document my progress of learning Vulkan.</p>
    <p>It mainly serves as a personal reference to revisit and reinforce concepts over time.</p>

    <p>Vulkan is known for its steep learning curve. The amount of work one has to do upfront is discouraging for many.</p>
    <p>However, I'll revise these topics thoroughly one after the other.</p>

    <p>This blog is based on the Khronos Vulkan Tutorial, which can be found here: https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html.</p>

    <p>If the reader is interested in getting a working Vulkan application, this blog post is not for you.</p>
    <p>It rather serves as a summary of key concepts of the API.</p>
