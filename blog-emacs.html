  <h2 id="what-is-emacs">What is Emacs?</h2>
  <p>
    Have you ever wished for a tool that adapts perfectly to your workflow, whether you’re coding, writing, or managing complex projects?
    Emacs isn’t just a text editor—it’s a powerhouse that evolves with your needs.
    From its customizable interface to its vast array of features, Emacs has become the go-to choice for developers, writers, and power users.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this blog post—written entirely in Emacs—I’ll introduce its major features.
  </p>

  <h2 id="installing-emacs">Installing Emacs</h2>
  <p>
    To follow along, install Emacs from
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html">the official website</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="configuring-emacs">Configuring Emacs</h2>
  <p>
    Emacs becomes powerful when you configure it to your liking. If you're used to Vim keybindings, enable <strong>Evil Mode</strong>—a minor mode for Vim emulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use Evil Mode myself. You can use my configuration:
    <a href="https://github.com/johannes-el/emacs-dotfiles">github.com/johannes-el/emacs-dotfiles</a>.
  </p>

  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash

git clone https://github.com/johannes-el/emacs-dotfiles --depth=1

if [ -d "$HOME/.emacs.d" ]; then
  rm -rf "$HOME/.emacs.d"
fi

mv emacs-dotfiles "$HOME/.emacs.d"
</code></pre>
